'''
Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

Type conversions
Conditional statements
Fixing errors in a program
Integer numbers
Floating-point numbers
Printing on screen
Scenario
Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis. Use the converted number to check how to round a float number.

Expected output
Five is: 5
Rounded to seven: 7

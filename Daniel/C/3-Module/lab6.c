Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

Logic of loops: do - while
Getting input from the user
Printing characters on screen
Scenario
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. Then:

the program should print the number of lines corresponding to the number inputted;
each line should contain the number of pairs of characters *# equal to the number of this line.
The outputted "drawing" should be similar to the right half of a pyramid.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. To do this lab,
you must use two do-while loops.

However:

when the user inputs a number less than or equal to 1, the program should print only one line;
When the user inputs a number greater than 20, the program should print only twenty lines.

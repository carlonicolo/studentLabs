Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

Using operators,
Building simple expressions,
Translating verbal description into programming language
Scenario
Take a look at the code we've provided in the editor: it assigns two integer values, manipulates them and finally outputs the result and bigresult variables.

The problem is that the manipulations have been described using natural language, so the code is completely useless now.

We want you to act as an intelligent (naturally!) compiler and to translate the formula into a real "C" code notation.

Test your code using the data we've provided.

Expected output
result: 38
big result: 54872

	int xValue=5;
	int yValue=9;
	int result;
	int bigResult;
	
	/* 
		increment xValue by 3
		decrement yValue by xValue
		multiply xValue times yValue giving result
		increment result by result
		decrement result by 1
		assign result modulo result to yValue
		increment result by result added to xValue
		assign result times result times result to bigResult
		increment result by xValue times yValue
